### Experiment No: 01

**Name of the Experiment**: Study of Different Git Commands.

**Objectives**:
- To get speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
- Git's branching features are among its greatest benefits.
- Git branches are inexpensive and simple to combine, in contrast to centralized version control systems.
- This makes it easier to employ the feature branch process, which is very popular among Git users.
- Feature branches give any update to your codebase an isolated environment.

### Theory

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. 

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. It is developed to coordinate the work among developers. Version control allows us to track and collaborate with team members in the same workspace. It allows us to keep track of all changes made in the project files. Every time changes are made, we can push them to a repository. Other developers can pull your changes and continue to work with the updates you added to the project.

4. **Git Commit Command**:  
   This command commits any files added to the repository with `git add` and commits any files you've changed since then.

5. **Git Clone Command**:  
   This command makes a copy of a repository from an existing URL.
