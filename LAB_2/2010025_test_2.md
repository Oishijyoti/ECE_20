# Basic Git Commands


Some basic git commands:

## 1. `git init`

-  Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This command creates a new repository or reinitialize an existing one, setting up the necessary Git metadata.

## 3. `git add <file_name>`

-  Adds a file to the staging area for the next commit. This command stages changes in the specified file, preparing them to be included in the next commit.

## 4. `git commit -m "<commit_message>"`

-  Records the changes made to the files in the repository along with a brief commit message. This command creates a new commit with the changes staged in the staging area.

## 5. `git status`

-  Displays the status of the working directory and the staging area. This command shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked, providing an overview of the repository's current state.

## 14. `git log`

-  Displays a chronological list of commits in the repository. The list includes details such as the commit hash, author, date, and commit message for each commit. This command is helpful for understanding the history of changes made to the repository and tracking down specific commits.

## 6. `git diff`

-  Shows the changes between the working directory and the staging area. This command highlights the differences between the current state of files in the working directory and the last commit or the staged changes.

## 7. `git push`

-  Pushes committed changes to a remote repository. This command uploads local commits to the remote repository, updating its history and making changes available to other collaborators.

## 8. `git pull`

-  Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to the local repository. This command retrieves changes from the remote repository and integrates them into the local branch, keeping the repository up-to-date.

## . `git rm <file_name>`

-  Removes a file from both the working directory and the staging area. This command deletes the specified file from the working directory and stages the deletion for the next commit.
