## Programming
Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems.  
At its most basic, programming tells a computer what to do. First, a programmer writes codeâ€”a set of letters, numbers, and other characters. Next, a compiler converts each line of code into a language a computer can understand. Then, the computer scans the code and executes it, thereby performing a task or series of tasks. Tasks might include displaying an image on a webpage or changing the font of a section of text. 
Some programming Languages are:
- C
- C++
- Java
- Python etc.

Here is a sample code in c:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello world");
    return 0;
}
```

## Scripting

Like all programming, scripting is a way of providing instructions to a computer so you can tell it what to do and when to do it. Programs can be designed to be interacted with manually by a user (by clicking buttons in the GUI or entering commands via the command prompt) or programmatically using other programs (or a mixture of both). 

Some scripting languages are:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Ruby

## Markup

A markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document and potentially the relationship between its parts.Markup can control the display of a document or enrich its content to facilitate automated processing.

e.g.
- HTML
- XML

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is intended to be easy to read in its source code form. Markdown is widely used for blogging and instant messaging, and also used elsewhere in online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

## Interconnection between markup and scripting language
#### HTML only

```HTML
<html>
  <body>
  <button type= "button" onclick="changeBackgroundColor()">Colorize</Button>  
  </body>
</html>
```
Output:
![html_output](https://github.com/sazid570/lab_report_1/blob/925fee501b7a5210ff565a3bae6eb10a300cf357/only_html.png?raw=true)
Simple button with no action.

#### HTML with CSS
```css
   button {
            background-color: #4CAF50; 
            border: none;  
            color: white;               
            padding: 15px 32px;         
            text-align: center;         
            text-decoration: none;     
            display: inline-block;     
            font-size: 16px;           
            margin: 10px 2px;           
            cursor: pointer;           
            border-radius: 8px;         
            transition: background-color 0.3s;
        }

        button:hover {
            background-color: #45a049; 
        }
 ```
 Output:
 ![with_css](https://github.com/sazid570/lab_report_1/blob/main/with_css.png?raw=true)
 Now the button is stylized but is han no action either.

 ### HTML, CSS and JavaScript
 ```js
  function changeBackgroundColor() {
            let randomColor = '#' + Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16);
            
           
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
        }

```
Output:
![with_js](https://github.com/sazid570/lab_report_1/blob/main/with_js.png?raw=true)
Now after clicking colorize it changes the background color.

# 5 Commands in command prompt

- To change the console color we can use: **color 2** - for making the console green, while 2 is the attribute for green.

- To see a episode of Star Wars in cmd, we can use **telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl**   
![a starwars character](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sazid570/software_report_2/main/Images/star_Wars.jpg)


But to use this we have to turn on an windows feature called `telnet`
- To see the system info try **Systeminfo**
![systeminfo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sazid570/software_report_2/main/Images/systeminfo.jpg)
- To know more about how a command works and what it's attributes are, type **Command /?** e.g. systeminfo /?
![systeminfo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sazid570/software_report_2/main/Images/use%20help.jpg)

- To check connectivity between my device and another host device we can test ping, to test use **ping google.com**
